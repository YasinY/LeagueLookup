# LeagueLookup
Please don't even bother to continue this project.

This doesn't have/follow: 
- Proper Resource handling
- Maven (dependency management)
- OOP-Standards
- Java conventions
- Proper threading/Multi threading
- Proper exception handling

Could have:
- Memory leaks

What it does have:
- Appending of data (generated by the league api dependency) through JS
- Scene handling (Opening new scenes properly)
- Custom FXML controls/node sets
- The approach of a cache system (not a real file system)

Feel free to copy this project's sourcecode, happy coding!
